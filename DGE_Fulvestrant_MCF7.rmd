The purpose of the workflow is to find differentially expressed genes from a RNA-seq dataset of 
 Estrogen-receptor+ breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7), one group treated with 
fulvestrant (estrogen inhibitor) and a untreated control group.

```{r}
#get a list of the raw reads in the directory /rnaseq
fastq.files <- list.files(path = "rnaseq/", pattern = ".fastq$", full.names = TRUE)
fastq.files
##abbreviate sample names
fastq.abbrv <- substr(fastq.files, start = 8, stop = 9)
